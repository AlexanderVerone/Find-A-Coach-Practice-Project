### My benefits from this project
It's my biggest non-commercial project based on Vue
On writing this project I've used such technologies as:  
- Vue.js for making SPA (I've used Vue CLI for creating a project)
- Vue router for making client-side routing in application
- VueX for storing global application data
- Wrote authorization logic
- Configure Firebase settings to manage users roles and proper access rights to different kind of users
- Firebase DB for storing and managing data on the server
- Gain an experience on deploying SPA to hosting
